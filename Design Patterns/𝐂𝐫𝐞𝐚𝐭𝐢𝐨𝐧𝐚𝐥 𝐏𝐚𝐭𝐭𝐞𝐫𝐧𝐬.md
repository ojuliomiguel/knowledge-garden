1. Factory Method - Abstract away the details of constructing complex objects.  
- Restaurants - you just order and receive the prepared food 🥗  
  
2. Builder - A simple interface for constructing complex objects, which also allows fine-grained control on how it’s constructed (unlike Factory).  
- Ordering food at Subway or Chipotle - you specify each ingredient but don’t have to make it yourself 🥪  
  
3. Singleton - Enforce that at most one instance of a class may exist.  
- Countries usually have at most one government (and sometimes none) 🏛️
